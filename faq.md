- Most people don’t realize that it’s not just serious water damage, such as flooding or a visible leak that leads to mold. Any kind of leak that isn’t properly fixed can cause mold to grow. … Under the right conditions, mold can begin to grow and spread in a matter of 24 to 48 hours
- ### How long does it take for mold to grow?
  - Mold can grow immediately after water damage, but it usually takes anywhere from 24-48 hours to establish itself.
- ### Does water damage get worse over time?
  - Water damage can cause serious issues in any home and if you don’t spot and deal with it quickly, then it is likely to deteriorate over time. Water damage not only tends to spread, but it can also cause the development of mold, which will grow on any surface it comes into contact with.

- It all depends on the size of the mold infestation and its location within your business. Mold removal estimates are given on a case-by-case basis, so it’s difficult to give a time frame. It’s also a bit of a misnomer to say, “remove mold completely.” 
- Mold is a naturally occurring organism, there are over 100,000 types and some is always present in trace amounts. We remove mold from your home, commercial property or business to restore it to pre-damage conditions or what’s considered “healthy.” Because of the complexity of types of mold, there’s actually no recognized “safe level” of mold.
- Keep in mind though, bleach does not remove mold. It simply removes the color from the mold you can see. It’s important to remove it at the root. We attack the mold from all angles and remove it discreetly.
