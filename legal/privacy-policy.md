We collect and utilize your personal data to provide and enhance our services. By using this service, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Google Analytics and Google Ads

Google Analytics primarily uses first-party cookies to report on user interactions with websites that utilize Google Analytics. Users have the option to disable cookies or delete individual cookies.

If a site or application integrates Google Analytics with other Google Advertising products, such as AdWords, additional advertising identifiers may be collected.

It is up to users of Google to opt out of this feature and manage their cookie settings through the Ads Settings. For more information, please refer to Google's support documentation.

Google Analytics also collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for the purpose of providing and securing our services and to give website owners insights into the geographical origin of their users (known as “IP geolocation”).

Google Analytics offers a method for masking IP addresses; however, website owners still have access to user IP addresses even if they do not utilize Google Analytics.
