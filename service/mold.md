By identifying and resolving moisture issues, we help prevent future mold growth and ensure long-lasting protection for your home.

## How Mold Infestation Starts 

Even a slight increase in moisture levels over an extended period is enough to trigger mold growth. Once it starts, even a small mold infestation in the basement can quickly spread throughout the rest of the home. Mold can develop in various ways, often due to excess moisture or poor ventilation.

For example, a malfunctioning HVAC system can create high humidity levels, while faulty plumbing may lead to standing water in dark, hidden corners. Once mold takes hold, it can grow rapidly, damaging surfaces and affecting indoor air quality. No matter the cause, addressing mold promptly is essential to maintaining a healthy and safe home environment.

### What are the Risks if Mold Goes Untreated?

- Poor indoor air quality.
- Sever property damage.
