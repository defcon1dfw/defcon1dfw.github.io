## When Mold Disaster Strikes.

In the early stages, a mold infestation may seem harmless and easy to manage. It might even seem reasonable to tackle it yourself by applying disinfectant, scraping it off, and repainting the affected area. However, consider that by the time you see a large amount of mold growing, enough that it covers a large surface, it usually means there is a constant supply of moisture to sustain that growth. This could be the result of a more significant problem that cannot be addressed with normal means.

In addition, property owners leasing to a tenant, (depending on the state and current federal law) may have be a legal obligation to disclose and repair the mold damaged properly in accordance with regulation.

## How Mold Infestation Starts 

Even a slight increase in moisture levels over an extended period is enough to trigger mold growth. Once it starts, even a small mold infestation in the basement can quickly spread throughout the rest of the home. Mold can develop in various ways, often due to excess moisture or poor ventilation.

For example, a malfunctioning HVAC system can create high humidity levels, while faulty plumbing may lead to standing water in dark, hidden corners. Once mold takes hold, it can grow rapidly, damaging surfaces and affecting indoor air quality. No matter the cause, addressing mold promptly is essential to maintaining a healthy and safe home environment.
